what is 'WHERE WAS HE LAST'?

this app is about where to find the last location of your favorite super hero.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

My idea is to use a superhero api so i can have all superheroes there are and make an edit in one of my views where the user can find a super hero and type in the last location he saw that particular superhero at. maybe add a list of superheroes this particular user likes in the index page.


## Phases of Completion
when one racer wins, a pop up of the racer will show up saying he won the race.

 day 1: pseudocode + api functionality.

 day 2: folders setup

 day 3: routes + controllers

 day 4:views

 day 5: debugs
